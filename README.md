# Private Messaging App

## Description
A privacy-centric messaging app designed for secure and private user communication. Built with React.js, Chakra UI, Go, Gin, and MongoDB, this app aims to offer a seamless and secure messaging experience across platforms.

There's a chance that the Go / Gin / MongoDB Backend is deprecated in favor of Python / Django / PostgreSQL.

The decision is not final yet.

## Key Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Secure sign-up and login process with strict form validation.
- **Chat Session Creation**: Users can start chat sessions via unique, server-validated URLs.
- **Security**: Enhanced security features including email verification, reCAPTCHA integration, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

## Future Implementations
- **WebRTC for P2P Voice Calls**: Planned implementation to enable secure, real-time voice communication.
- **Electron Framework**: In-progress work to transition the web app into a standalone desktop application for Windows.
- **Additional Security Measures**: Ongoing efforts to enhance user privacy and data protection.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with Next.js, Chakra UI
- **Backend**: Go with Gin framework, MongoDB
- **Security**: reCAPTCHA, JWT

## Current Progress
- Robust backend architecture using Go and Gin for efficient performance.
- User-friendly UI designed with React.js and Chakra UI.
- Secure user authentication system with email verification and reCAPTCHA.
